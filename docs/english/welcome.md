#:octicons-heart-fill-24:{.heart}Welcome to the Ludaro Wiki:octicons-heart-fill-24:{.heart}#

The **Ludaro Wiki** is a private project created and maintained solely by me (Ludaro), a German developer. 

My goal with this project is to improve the development environment in **Five-M** and provide valuable resources to learning developers.

This documentation is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand. It is not intended to serve as a comprehensive reference, but rather as a helpful guide for those who are new to Five-M development.

As the sole developer behind this project, I am always willing to provide assistance and tutorials to those who need it. The Wiki itself has sections in both **English** and **German**, making it accessible to a wider audience.

If you need additional assistance or have any questions, feel free to contact me on **Discord** (Louvii <3#0815). I am always here to help!
