# What is NativeUI?

NativeUI is a powerful user interface library for creating interactive menus and UI elements in the popular game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). It provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities to design and implement dynamic menus, submenus, items, and more within their custom game modifications.

## The Need for NativeUI

As the modding community for GTA V continues to grow, developers are constantly seeking ways to enhance the gameplay experience. One essential aspect of creating immersive mods is the ability to present information, options, and actions to players through intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.

NativeUI fills this need by offering a reliable and flexible solution to create custom menus and UI elements in GTA V. It allows developers to seamlessly integrate interactive interfaces into their mods, making it easier for players to navigate and interact with various in-game features.

## The Challenge of Documentation

One significant challenge that developers face when working with NativeUI is the lack of comprehensive documentation. While the library itself has gained popularity and recognition within the modding community, there is no official wiki or centralized resource providing detailed information, examples, and guidelines on how to use NativeUI effectively.

Developers often rely on scattered forum posts, community discussions, and trial-and-error methods to understand the library's functionalities and best practices. This fragmented knowledge can be time-consuming and frustrating, hindering the development process and limiting the potential of NativeUI.

## NativeUI vs. NativeUIReloaded: A Comparison of Two Versions

Within the GTA V modding community, you will encounter two versions of the NativeUI library: NativeUI and NativeUIReloaded. Although both versions serve a similar purpose, they differ in terms of features, performance, and development status. Let's delve into the reasons behind the existence of these two versions and examine their pros and cons.

### NativeUI

NativeUI, the original version of the library, has been widely used by modders for a considerable period. Developed in C#, NativeUI provides a solid foundation for creating interactive menus and UI elements in GTA V mods. It has been a go-to choice for many developers due to its established presence and familiarity.

#### Pros of NativeUI

- **Established Presence:** NativeUI has a strong community following, with ample resources, examples, and support available.
- **Familiarity:** Developers who have experience with C# find NativeUI's syntax and usage intuitive.
- **Compatibility:** NativeUI works with various versions of GTA V and popular modding frameworks.

#### Cons of NativeUI

- **Limited Development:** NativeUI's development has ceased, resulting in no new updates or improvements.
- **Performance Limitations:** In complex menu scenarios or with a large number of menu items, NativeUI may exhibit performance limitations.

### NativeUIReloaded

NativeUIReloaded emerged as a newer version of the library, developed in Lua. It aims to address some of the performance concerns of NativeUI while introducing optimizations and enhancements to enhance the modding experience.

#### Pros of NativeUIReloaded

- **Performance Improvements:** NativeUIReloaded prioritizes performance optimization, making it more efficient for handling complex menus and a significant number of menu items.
- **Ongoing Development:** NativeUIReloaded is actively developed, with updates and improvements being made to address issues and introduce new features.
- **Enhanced Features:** NativeUIReloaded may offer additional features or functionalities not found in the original NativeUI, expanding modding possibilities.

#### Cons of NativeUIReloaded

- **Less Established:** As a newer iteration, NativeUIReloaded may have fewer available resources, examples, and community support compared to NativeUI.
- **Transition Challenges:** Migrating from NativeUI to NativeUIReloaded may require adapting existing code, which can be time-consuming and potentially introduce compatibility issues with existing mods.

## Conclusion

Both NativeUI and NativeUIReloaded offer modders options based on their preferences and requirements. NativeUI's strength lies in its established community presence, while NativeUIReloaded focuses on performance enhancements and ongoing development.

It is worth noting that both versions have ceased active development. However, NativeUIReloaded, being the newer iteration and developed in Lua, may offer improved performance compared to NativeUI. Modders should consider factors such as community support, compatibility with other mods, desired features, and performance requirements when choosing between the two.

Ultimately, the decision hinges on the individual modder's goals, existing codebase, and the specific demands of their GTA V modding project.
