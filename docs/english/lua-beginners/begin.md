Hey there, Lua enthusiasts! I'm Ludaro, and I'm here to help you learn Lua programming specifically for Fivem. This wiki is dedicated to providing simple tips and guidance for beginners like you who are interested in mastering Lua.

Lua is a beginner-friendly programming language, but it's not the only language used in Fivem. You can also code in C# and JS, which are more complex. Don't worry though, I'll cover those languages in this wiki as well, if I find the time for it ;)

When it comes to learning Lua, I encourage you to approach it with passion, not just out of necessity. Feel free to explore different learning methods and find what works best for you. Remember, learning Lua should be a journey that you enjoy and find fulfilling.

To start off, it's important to have a clear reason for learning Lua and how you plan to utilize your scripts. Think about what makes your scripts special and what you want to achieve with them. Additionally, consider if you want to work with NUIs (Native UI) and if so, start by learning Lua first, then move on to JS, HTML, and CSS.

If you prefer learning Lua with a tutor, I highly recommend checking out the [MyScripts-Lua-Learning Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZL-wemJPHY5JG4kqcOX6TYHj0iCeT_I) (German language, but subtitles are available). If you prefer a more wiki-style approach, then join me on this exciting journey and read everything I've compiled on this topic!

Before diving into Lua, it's essential to have some basic knowledge. For example, "--" is used to comment out code, meaning the server will ignore those lines. It's commonly used to write notes or temporarily disable a function that isn't working correctly. These comments are meant for your eyes only and won't affect the code execution.

Let's get started on your Lua programming adventure! Feel free to explore the rest of the wiki and enjoy learning Lua for Fivem.
